Bismark report for: test2.fq and test1.fq (version: v0.19.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /mnt/Bioinfo_Student2/Ting_Gong/Ting_Gong/hg38_bismark/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 -p 4 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 1000
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	1000
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	870
Mapping efficiency:	87.0% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	75
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	55
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	436	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	434	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
